# Basic Search Algorithms used in AI 
Simple python implementation of search algorithms used in AI by agents in order to find the best possible state.

## Algorithms Implemented
* Best-First Search ( BFS )
* Uniform-Cost Search ( UCS )
* A*

# Getting Started
* Simply clone the repository via git `git clone https://github.com/ttomtsis/python-ai-search-algorithms`
* Navigate to the project directory
* Use python to run the main python script (bfs.py) `python3 bfs.py`
